# Brashnet

This is a basic website I threw together to host on my Raspberry Pi. Right now it only features links to local IP addresses on my network for quick-access to my administrative features.
It was a good chance to brush up on HTML and CSS, and to get familiar with pushing, pulling, and cloning on Github.

Workflow:
1) Create changes to project files in /brashnet on local machine.
2) In Terminal, git commit -m "Comment" then git push.
3) SSH'd into my webserver, git clone github.com/branjames117/brashnet for the first time.
4) After, git pull.
